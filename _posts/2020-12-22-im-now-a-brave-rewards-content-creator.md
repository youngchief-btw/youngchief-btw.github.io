Have you ever heard of Brave Rewards?
If you haven't, here's a rundown of Brave & Brave Rewards:
- Brave is an open-source privacy-focused web browser.
- It rewards **Basic Attention Token (BAT)** tokens for the time that you invest on privacy-respecting ads.
- You can use BAT for redeeming gift cards, supporting content creators, and more.
- It only works on the Brave browser.
- BAT tokens have [actual value](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/basic-attention-token/).

So today, I decided to become a verified content creator on Brave, so that people can send me BAT tokens when they are on pages such as my domains, GitHub profile, and more as another method of donating to me.

I also decided to enable Brave Ads to show on my domains when being visited using Brave. Don't worry :) they aren't annoying and don't track you or anything like that.
